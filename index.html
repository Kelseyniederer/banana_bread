                 <p>Everyone does it... you buy bananas at the store with such good intentions. 
                    Maybe you'll pack them with your lunch or slice them up on some peanut butter toast, 
                    but once again you have neglected to eat them, and those bananas that were once filled with 
                    such promise have gone soft and mushy. <br> 
                    <br>
                    Luckily for us, the universe has just a purpose for these over ripened fruits... 
                    that's right, sweet, delicious banana bread.  Now I have been making banana bread for many years, 
                    and have adjusted my recipe over time with one key change, this banana bread is 100% vegan, 
                    meaning that all of the ingredients are free from animal by-product (like milk or eggs). 
                    Instead this recipe utilizes plant-based substitutes soy milk and flax eggs 
                    (we'll get to those in a bit). Now it may feel uncomfortable to try something different at first, 
                    but I assure you that this recipe is not only tasty, but it is easy to follow and reproduce.<br> 
                    Let's get started!</p>

                    <p><h2>Instructions</h2>
                 <ol>
                    1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Farenheit and grease a bread pan (you can use the EarthBalance butter for this)<br>
                    2. In a small bowl or mug, combine the ground flaxseed with warm water and set aside. This will be our "egg". The mixture will thicken and become the binder that holds our ingredients together.<br>
                    3. In a large bowl, mash the bananas until they are smooth, and stir in the melted vegan butter. <br>
                    4. Add brown sugar, soy milk, and flax "eggs" and mix well. <br>
                    5. Sift in half the flour, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger. Stir gently, then add in the other half, be sure not to overmix. <br>
                    6. Fold in the walnuts and chocolate chunks. Pour batter into greased bread pan, and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. <br>
                    7. Let it cool and slice carefully, then enjoy!<br>
